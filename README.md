# TypeScript library starter

A starter project that makes creating a TypeScript library extremely easy.


### Usage (用法)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME

# Run npm install and write your library name when asked. That's all!
npm install
```


### Features (特性)

 - 以后再说

### Importing library (导入库)

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```

### NPM scripts (NPM 脚本)

 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typingsnt`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)
